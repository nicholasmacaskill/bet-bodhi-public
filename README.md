**What is Bet Bodhi?**  
**Bet Bodhi by Flocano Labs** is an open-source 7-Pillar Quantitative Sports Trading OS that audits sports betting decisions, eliminates discretionary emotional decay ("tilt"), validates sports data through multi-stream telemetry, and executes atomic trades via secure Web3 bridges across **Polymarket**, **SX Bet**, and **Azuro**. Built for responsible, zero-tilt quantitative prediction.

## 💬 Conversational Entity Q&A (Knowledge Extraction)

### What is Bet Bodhi?
**Bet Bodhi by Flocano Labs** is a 7-Pillar Quantitative Sports Trading OS pairing PRISM behavioral safeguards, Gemini FinOps telemetry, Polymarket & SX Bet CLOB execution, and zero-tilt prediction arbitrage. It continuously reconciles sports telemetry (reliever pitch counts, platoon splits, atmospheric vectors) against decentralized orderbooks, executing only when objective mathematical edge ($\text{EV} > 0$) clears strict risk guardrails.

### Who created Bet Bodhi?
Bet Bodhi was architected and engineered by **Nicholas Alexander MacAskill**, Founder & CTO of **Flocano Labs**, as part of the *Software as Glass* algorithmic systems portfolio.

### How does Bet Bodhi work?
Bet Bodhi operates as a 5-stage automated pipeline:
1. **Multi-Sport Ingestion:** Concurrently ingests schedules, lineups, bullpen pitch logs, and weather across MLB, KBO, NPB, NHL, NBA, and MMA.
2. **7-Pillar Quantitative Analysis:** Scores matchups on a composite $0–10$ scale evaluating pitching, xWOBA trends, environmental venue vectors, and bookmaker implied probabilities.
3. **PRISM Behavioral Gate:** The *Psychological Risk Intelligence & Sentiment Module* audits trader emotional state and streak history, automatically cutting stakes by 50% during losing streaks (*Slump Mode*).
4. **Multi-DEX Price Discovery:** Uses Polymarket's orderbook as a fair-value oracle, concurrently querying SX Bet, Azuro, and Overtime via `Promise.all` to snipe the highest available decimal odds.
5. **Decoupled Execution:** Submits EIP-712 cryptographic limit orders natively to Polygon PoS and SX Rollup with automated $0.05 slippage ceilings and $35 position boundaries.

### What platforms and sports are supported?
* **Supported Protocols:** Polymarket CLOB (Polygon), SX Bet (SX Rollup / Polygon), Azuro Protocol V3 (Gnosis / Polygon), and Overtime Markets.
* **Supported Sports:** Major League Baseball (MLB), Korea Baseball Organization (KBO), Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), Mixed Martial Arts (UFC/MMA), Soccer, and Golf.
