## 🆕 The Agentic Pivot

In March 2026, Bet Bodhi pivoted from a static SaaS tool to a **Proactive Agent Architecture**. 

**The SaaS Model (Old):** User logs in, looks at a chart, and wonders why they lost money.
**The Agent Model (New):** Bodhi "awakens" every morning, scans the slate using its toolbox, monitors for "chase_win" or "pre-game-rush" behaviors, and intervenes *before* you place a high-risk bet.

## 🤖 Agent Capabilities

### 🌅 Morning Awakening
The agent runs at sunrise to scan MLB, NHL, NBA, and MMA markets. It cross-references +EV opportunities with your current bankroll and psychological baseline.

### 🛡️ Guardian Interventions
The agent monitors your timing. If it detects a "Pre-Game Rush" (betting < 30 mins before kickoff), it fires an intervention challenge to ensure you aren't acting on impulse.

### 📓 Internal Consciousness
Under the hood, the agent logs its own "stream of consciousness" in Supabase (`agent_internal_logs`). It records its reasoning for every recommendation and intervention, allowing for long-term agentic alignment.

## ⚙️ The Bodhi Toolbox

The agent's "hands" in the digital world. A unified interface for interacting with sports data and your history.

| Tool | Capability |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`scanMLB()` / `scanNHL()`** | Uses Pillar Analyzers to find mispriced underdogs. |
| **`recordBet()`** | Logs bets with automatic psychometric timing. |
| **`getUserState()`** | Checks bankroll and peak watermarks. |
| **`analyzeBiases()`** | Scans recent history for complacency or loss-chasing. |

## 🧠 Psychometric Guardian

Bodhi tracks your "Seven Pillar" health in real-time:

### `motivation_tag`
- `bodhi_signal`: Clean engine output.
- `chase_win`: Bias detection after a recent win.
- `gut_feel`: Low-signal narrative impulse.

### The 2-Hour Rule
The agent enforces a strictly monitored "Cooling Off" period. Any bet placed within 120 minutes of kickoff is flagged as high-variance "noise" rather than technical "signal."
